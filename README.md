Hello everyone, this is a minimal set of tools to help you create a bot for Amino, as well as a bot named Ram, I hope you will not have any problems using it and you will enjoy your work

It is worth noting in advance that to launch a bot or tools, it is advisable to use a computer (you can also use a phone, but that's another story).
To install python on your system, you need to find a suitable YouTube video and have this site with you https://www.python.org/downloads/
After installing python, you will need to install Amino.py
as? do you know how to do it? well, I will tell you a way for Windows, although it is also suitable for Linux, but slightly different manipulations are needed
Run CMD as administrator and write
pip install --upgrade Amino.py == 1.2.8

If you did not succeed, write this
pip install Amino.py==1.2.12.1
pip install requests==2.24.0
pip install websocket_client==0.57.0

That's it! now just move the code file to the cmd line and click Enter!

about the amino-community-id.py file To find out the Amino identifier, you need to log into the bot account manually and Join the community where it will work, and then, launch Lear.py, the identifier will be displayed in the console, upload it to Ram.py or your bot, and launch the bot, done

If you have any ideas / questions / suggestions / problems, then write to me either on Discord or here on github, and remember, I only have two hands! so wait, sooner or later I will answer you
