Hello everyone, this is an Amino bot named Ram, I hope when using it you will not have any problems and you will experience pleasure in its operation, but when creating it, I experienced contentment

It is worth noting in advance that to run the bot, it is desirable to need a computer (you can use a phone, but this is another story)
To install python on your system, you need to find a suitable video on YouTube and have this site with you https://www.python.org/downloads/
After installing python, you will need to install Amino.py
what? you don't know how to do this? well, I will tell you the method for Windows, although it is also suitable for Linux, but there are slightly different manipulations needed
now, run CMD as an administrator and write 
pip install --upgrade Amino.py==1.2.8

If you did not succeed, write this
pip install Amino.py==1.2.12.1
pip install requests==2.24.0
pip install websocket_client==0.57.0

That's it! now just move the code file to the cmd line and click Enter!

about the file lear.py To find out the Amino id, you need to log in to the bot's account manually and go to the community where it will work, and then run lear.py, the console will display the ID, it remains to throw it in Ram.py and launch the bot, done

If you have any ideas/questions/suggestions/problems, then write to me either in discord, or here, in github, and remember, I only have two hands! so just wait, sooner or later I will answer you

Help for you: All my codes were originally developed for the Russian audience, I have no desire to engage in localization, at least at the moment, if there are many requests for this, then I will completely localize the bot to English, starting with the new version, if of course this bot will be needed by many
